description: 'QR Eats is a QR code link to the menu of a restaurant'
mission: 'During the Covid-19 crisis, restaurant had to adapt to be able to give you a menu that you could touch. The easiest choice was to create a QR code linked to the restaurant menu in pdf.
<br />
<br />With this project, I wanted to design an app that would be easy to use for the customer and easy to setup for the restaurant.'
